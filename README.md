# JSCalc

👋 This is JSCalc — simple javascript online calculator, source of the https://jscalc.net/ site.

🔢 You can write any expressions in the input line, simple, like `2 + 2`, or complex, like `1 + tan(45 * PI/180) `.

📚 You can find full list of math functions and constants on this page: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math.

👩‍💻 Syntax of all expression is JavaScript syntax. If you know JavaScript, you can use almost any JS expressions, including variables and objects/arrays.

⛓ Any calculated result can be used in following code lines. There is special variable named `_` (underscore), which is stores the result of calculation in previous line.

🧭 Use arrows (↑, ↓ or Enter) to code navigation. Shift+↑ adds new line before current line and Shift+↓ (or Shift+Enter) adds new line after current.

📋 Press Ctrl+C in the empty input and the result of the previous line will be copied to clipboard.

💣 And the last thing: you can make errors:) Wrote an invalid expression and JSCalc will tell you about it. As the following lines depend on the previous, you must fix the error before moving on.
